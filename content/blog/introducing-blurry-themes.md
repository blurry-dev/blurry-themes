# Introducing Blurry themes

_Note: This is mostly here to show what a post looks like on [the blog index page](./index.md), but perhaps it can be useful in its own right._

## Why did Blurry need themes?

It's a good question!
Let's look at a few answers.

### Answer 1: lower barrier to entry

For starters, having a theme makes it easier to get started with [Blurry](https://github.com/blurry-dev/blurry).
My brother wanted to build a site with Blurry, for example, but the lack of a theme meant that he'd have to build one from scratch, which is a lot to ask of someone trying out a new static site generator.

### Answer 2: better example

A theme (and a site showcasing the theme) also provides a better real-world example of what a Blurry site looks like.
Sure, [the Blurry documentation site](https://blurry-docs.netlify.app/) has [open-source templates](https://github.com/blurry-dev/blurry/tree/main/docs/templates) that could be used as a starting point for another theme.
But the documentation theme is very much single-purpose and lacks the "wow" factor.

### Answer 3: swankier demo

Building on Answer 2, good-looking themes can make Blurry a more viable choice for people looking for a static site generator.
In general, seeing a clean website built with a library can help build confidence in that library.
